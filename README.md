# TIL (Today I Learned)
We learn a lot of things every day.  
We also forget a lot of things every day.  
This repo is to collect & save those things and make my own wiki.  

## Rules
The rules for TIL is as follows:  

* Free to use any language although [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) is preferred  
* Every documents **must** be catagorized
